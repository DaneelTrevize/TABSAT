# TABSAT
They Are Billions Save Automation Tool

This tool is formed of 2 parts, the main application TABSAT.exe, and a sister binary TABReflector.exe

Simply download both files to the same directory, and launch TABSAT.exe

In the process of subverting TAB to extract passworded save files, the Reflector component is automatically temporarily copied into your TAB install directory and launched in another process. The main application interacts with this process, and handles tidying the Reflector away once it is no longer needed or the app is closed.

For more information about the goals of this project, see TABSAT.txt
