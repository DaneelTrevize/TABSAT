# Save Modification Features

The following Save Modification options have been implemented, and are categorised below by how they affect the game difficulty:

## Make the game easier

* Removing all Mutants (i.e. as 800% was before June 2019).

* Relocating all Mutants, or Giants, to the position of the furthest Mutant, or Giant, either considering the whole map at once or on a per compass direction quadrant basis (i.e. moving all Northern Mutants to the Northern Giant most distant from the Command Center).

* Removing all 'Fog of War', enabling players to see the terrain, VODs, reclaimable buildings (e.g. Radar Towers) and pickable items (e.g. Food Trucks).

* Removing the Fog in a circle centered on the Command Center, of variable tile/cell radius.

* Granting constant full map vision, as though you have 'The Beholder', or the final wave has begun.

* Removing the 'Villages of Doom'.

* Granting free/bonus units and buildings, of variable number (e.g. 3 Rangers, or 1 Titan).

## Situational difficulty adjustments

* Replacing all Mutants with Giants, and vice versa.

* Resizing all VOD buildings to Dwellings (the smallest), Taverns, or City Halls (the largest), which should also affect resource drops.  
N.b. City Halls can spawn thousands more zombies and cause pathing issues, which leads to lag.

* Changing the map Theme. This not only changes the visuals and background sound, but also inherits the rules modifiers of the standard themes, such as Frozen Highlands slowing zombies & increasing power consumption, or Desert Wasteland increasing zombie speed and range of noise.

## Make the game harder

* Enable Swarms (Waves) to come from several directions. Earlier swarms can come from any 2 cardinal directions at once, later swarms from any 3.  
N.b. The on-screen text and icons will represent all chosen directions, but the audio announcement will only name the first direction per swarm.

* Disabling Mayors. No new mayors will be granted for reaching colony population thresholds.
