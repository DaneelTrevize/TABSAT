# Save Modification Features

The following Save Modification options have been implemented, and are categorised below by how they affect the game difficulty:

## Make the game easier

* Removing all Mutants (i.e. as 800% was before June 2019).

* Relocating all Mutants, or Giants, to the position of the furthest Mutant, or Giant, either considering the whole map at once or on a per compass direction quadrant basis (i.e. moving all Northern Mutants to the Northern Giant most distant from the Command Center).

* Removing all 'Fog of War', enabling players to see the terrain, VODs, reclaimable buildings (e.g. Radar Towers) and pickable items (e.g. Food Trucks).

* Removing the Fog in a circle centered on the Command Center, of variable tile/cell radius.

* Granting constant full map vision, as though you have 'The Beholder', or the final wave has begun.

* Removing the 'Villages of Doom'.

* Granting free/bonus units and buildings, of variable number (e.g. 3 Rangers, or 1 Titan).

## Situational difficulty adjustments

* Replacing all Mutants with Giants, and vice versa.

* Resizing all VOD buildings to either the smallest (Dwellings) or largest (City Halls), which should also affect resource drops.

* Changing the map Theme. This not only changes the visuals and background sound, but also inherits the rules modifiers of the standard themes, such as Frozen Highlands slowing zombies & increasing power consumption, or Desert Wasteland increasing zombie speed and range of noise.

## Make the game harder

* Disabling Mayors. No new mayors will be granted for reaching colony population thresholds.
