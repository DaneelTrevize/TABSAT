TAB Save Automation Tool

Purposes:
1) Automate backing up save files as they're generated, to ease "save-scumming".

2) Remove some/all Mutants from saves, because they're not very fun (and 800% was the same score multiplier without them).

"Mods, Editing Save Games, and Creating Game Maps

They Are Billions now comes with a Custom Level editor. Players now can create and play custom levels and this is officially supported.

Nevertheless, any alteration of game files, de-compiling the game or creating external applications to edit maps or save games are not allowed in any case . Any reference to those tools will be banned from the forum. Indeed, that's a copyright infringement."

Editing save games isn't copyright infringement, nor is using the game's own legally-obtained assemblies to do it, it's Fair Use.


Requirement:
DISABLE STEAM CLOUD for TAB!

--------
1)
The game auto-saves when you choose to exit, and periodically and/or around waves starting/ending.
There's also a Backup second set of files produced (after the 2nd and subsequent saves?). Currently unsure if files are renamed to become backups, or if they are edited in situ.
These saves & their check files can be copied after creation, and later restored to roll back game progress.
Games are keyed by filename, multiple copies of a single game's saves will have the same name, thus a saves folder structure is required.
Saves are deleted once a game is won/lost, thus over time saves' names can repeat.
Automate save versioning via FileSystemWatcher?

--------
2)
Saves are in passworded (PKZip 2.0?), lossless compression (DEFLATE?) format which tools like 7-Zip can open, given the correct password.
According to TheyAreBillionsModKit, passwords vary per save file.
Internally, there are 2 files, Info and Data, in XML formats.
Mutants can be removed, either all or by calculated distance from Command Center.
Edited saves must be repacked & encrypted, and have fresh checksums generated.

"The current save format uses the decades-old PKzip crypto, which is vulnerable to KP attacks and also limits the *effective* password length to 13 or so characters regardless of how long the password is. This is because since there's only 13 bytes in the state, many different passwords (aka shorter than the ones you've picked) will also map to the same internal state, similar to how X mod Y will have many different X that map to Y. In this case, it's Password mod 13chars, which means the password on the encrypted save files are vulnerable to attack."

If saves can be successfully shared with other players, the passwords cannot involve: hardware IDs, Steam IDs, per game install unique keys.
23rd Jan 2020: Advancing unzipped file's timestamps to 'DateTime.Now' doesn't seem to be required to repack, password and load successfully. Probably only filenames drive the password?

TAB assemblies appear to have been obfuscating using Eazfuscator. Tools such as EazFixer exist to attempt to reverse this.
