

Better handle _decrypted already exist? Use a temp directory if set to Tidy Away extracted files anyway?

Verify more parameters & returns, files/directories existing, Mutants/Giants existing, etc.


Provide a button to stop the Reflector whenever it's running?

Provide an option to leave the Reflector deployed, and verify whether it is during ReflectorManager initialisation? Including file checksum?


Refactor TABSAT's own Console...WriteLine() to use a UI textfield/list, at the bottom of the UI/on another pane?


Would TABReflector need to technically be a graphical application, with a hidden window, in order for Process.WaitForInputIdle() to best solve the Sleep() race condition?

Options for Mutant modification/max % restoration:

#Delete all mutants.

Relocate mutants onto giants:
nearest giant per mutant;
#giant furthest from CC;
giant furthest from CC within cardinal map quarter (divide diagonally), if non in quadrant find next nearest/furthest from CC globally?

Relocate if within l distance of CC? To those Giants/Mutants at least l distance from CC?

Relocate mutants onto smaller zombies at the map edge/at least l distance from the CC? Less likely to avoid terrain clipping than relocating onto giants.

Replace all mutants with smaller zombies. Harpies?

Wide-ranging editor options:

Adjust zombie type ratios for even harder procedurally-generated maps.
Potentially also increase the % score scale factor for such maps?

Without needing to generate new zombie IDs, we could just swap the locations of different types to affect distribution difficulty. Depends upon generating LevelFastSerializedEntities?

Alter the size and composition of waves?
Alter the number and timing of waves?

Offer to enlarge the default fog-clearing as a circle of adjustable radius around the CC.

Upgrade all smaller VOD buildings (Dwelling, Tavern) to City Halls of Doom? To try recreate UberVOD(s) on other ThemeTypes?
Or multi-stack the same sized buildings in the same position?

Or, to offset other changes and make things easier, offer to remove Taverns/City Halls?

Remove all Pickable resources & reclaimable buildings? To remove potential early Radar vision or resources chiefly accessed via kiting?

Other features:

Use a series of auto-backed-up saves during a game to chart the player's economy, pause ratio, zombie kill rate, potential turret & army dps, etc.
