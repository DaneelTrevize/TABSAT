
Offer to toggle Enable/Disable state of Mayors, Showing full map, etc? So users needn't manually edit to revert such options.

Potentially decrypt any save file upon selection, in order to assess and present the current state? Requires triggering the reflector popup though.
Check the time elapsed in a save before permitting some changes?
Check if any changes have actually been made by a given option set, and thus if repacking can be skipped?

Also update Info file, just to be consistent with Data file?

Consider approaches to keeping Backups TreeView sorted by baseName, then lastWriteUtc. Either via custom sorter, or careful insertion of single backups when generated.

Use state Enums, FSM and change listeners for GUI/TABSAT when modifying file, and ReflectorManager?


Provide a button to stop the Reflector whenever it's running?

Provide an option to leave the Reflector deployed, and verify whether it is during ReflectorManager initialisation? Including file checksum?


Add a blank "Log" Tab Control page, which when chosen collapses the control's height and the enclosing SplitContainer.Panel's, to maximise the log panel's height?


Refactor TABSAT's own Console...WriteLine() to use a UI textfield/list, at the bottom of the UI/on another pane?


Would TABReflector need to technically be a graphical application, with a hidden window, in order for Process.WaitForInputIdle() to best solve the Sleep() race condition?


Consider using something like Octokit.net or Squirrel.Windows for auto-updating TABSAT from Github?

Options for Mutant modification/max % restoration:

Relocate mutants onto giants:
nearest giant per mutant;

Relocate if within l distance of CC? To those Giants/Mutants at least l distance from CC?

----

Wide-ranging editor options:

--
Make games harder:

Remove Mutants and/or Giant minimap icons?

Alter existing (outer) zombies to be more special types, depending on adjustable (min?) distance from CC and desired %/final ratio of specials?

Multi-stack the same sized VOD buildings in the same position?
Give individual duplication options (including 0x, excluding 1x) for each VOD building type?

Remove all Pickable resources & reclaimable buildings? To remove potential early Radar vision or resources chiefly accessed via kiting?

Possibly add a script element (that constantly loops?) to spawns a new zombie per troop loss, with specific loss type to zombie spawned pairing. E.g. Harpy for each ranger, Spitter for each Sniper, Mutant for each Thanatos?
Might have to have a pseudo daily/8-hourly/faster wave, that spawns unit types & numbers depending on a diff between previous and current troop counts? So quickly replaced units might not trigger snowballing?

Could affect difficulty either way:

Swap the locations of different types to affect distribution difficulty. Depends upon generating LevelFastSerializedEntities?
Specifically, could:
place most/all special infected in concentric rings, e.g. Fatties closest, then Spitters, then Harpies?
place most/all Spitters in 1 cardinal direction, all Harpies in another, all Fatties, etc?

Swap the closest Mutants with the farthest Giants?

Alter the size and composition of waves?
Alter the number and timing of waves?
Effectively could offer 50-day challenge map on demand?

Set certain mayors as already chosen? To benefit or miss out on their benefits, depending how they're handled.

Alter the starting troops?

Add the scripted politics systems from some custom maps?

Apply a multiplier all (non-huge) map zombies' life (e.g. 0.8, 1.5)? Or per zombie type. Would need to test whether exceeding the base full life value for a given type causes issues beyond displaying e.g. 150/100, as this probably isn't how modded mayors effectively alter this value.

Investigate scripting a custom CC button that effectively toggles the game pace between normal and fast. Unit speed & dps, and tech research speed, seems to be modifiable in a single game (see some custom maps), so perhaps a script could apply a pair of factors to these stats, and waves could be triggered rather than purely scheduled if schedules can't be modified?

Clear straight/spiral paths from the CC to the edges in cardinal directions?

--
Make games easier:

Reposition Ravens to indicate direction to Mutants/Giants/VODs?
Or use sign post assets from custom/campaign maps?
For VODs, convert each building relative position from CC into an angle, consolidate similar-enough angles into a single marker.

Add extra Food/Energy(/Workers) to CC, as though from pickables?
Or spawn new pickables by the CC.
Or relocate existing pickables to be by the CC.

Make all existing troops veterans.

Add the scripted pseudo-train system from some custom maps, for regular delivery of chosen resources?

----

Other features:

Use a series of auto-backed-up saves during a game to chart the player's economy, pause ratio, zombie kill rate, potential turret & army dps, etc.
Charts could be compared across games to see averages and long term trends.

Offer to apply or revert Modded Mayors game-wide rules change?

Also Sound/Texture/Font packs such as https://www.reddit.com/r/TheyAreBillions/comments/ekc8gx/starcraft_warcraft_diablo2_dow2_soundpacks_like_a/
