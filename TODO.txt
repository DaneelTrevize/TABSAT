Provide an option to stop the Reflector as often as possible, requiring restarting it between uses during a single usage of TABSAT? Would also need to split out stop/start and deploy/delete in ReflectorManager.

Provide options to:
Simply extract, modify and repact in 1 button click.
To skip backing up the save file before repacking the potentially modified data.

Refactor TABSAT's own Console...WriteLine() to use a UI textfield, at the bottom of the UI/on another pane?


----

Options for Mutant modification/max % restoration:

Delete all mutants.

Relocate mutants onto giants:
nearest giant per mutant;
giant furthest from CC;
giant furthest from CC within cardinal map quarter (divide diagonally), if non in quadrant find next nearest/furthest from CC globally?

Relocate mutants onto smaller zombies at the map edge/at least l distance from the CC? Less likely to avoid terrain clipping than relocating onto giants.

Replace all mutants with smaller zombies. Harpies?


----

Wide-ranging editor options:

Adjust zombie type ratios for even harder procedurally-generated maps.
Potentially also increase the % score scale factor for such maps?

Set <Simple name="ShowFullMap"... true to effectively give Beholder for free.
Modify <Simple name="LayerFog"... to potentially reveal all terrain but not zombies?

----

Other features:

Use a series of auto-backed-up saves during a game to chart the player's economy, pause ratio, zombie kill rate, potential turret & army dps, etc.
