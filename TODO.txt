
Consider approaches to keeping Backups TreeView sorted by baseName, then lastWriteUtc. Either via custom sorter, or careful insertion of single backups when generated.

Use state Enums, FSM and change listeners for GUI/TABSAT when modifying file, and ReflectorManager?


Provide a button to stop the Reflector whenever it's running?

Provide an option to leave the Reflector deployed, and verify whether it is during ReflectorManager initialisation? Including file checksum?


Add a blank "Log" Tab Control page, which when chosen collapses the control's height and the enclosing SplitContainer.Panel's, to maximise the log panel's height?


Refactor TABSAT's own Console...WriteLine() to use a UI textfield/list, at the bottom of the UI/on another pane?


Would TABReflector need to technically be a graphical application, with a hidden window, in order for Process.WaitForInputIdle() to best solve the Sleep() race condition?


Consider using something like Octokit.net or Squirrel.Windows for auto-updating TABSAT from Github?

Options for Mutant modification/max % restoration:

#Delete all mutants.

Relocate mutants onto giants:
nearest giant per mutant;
#giant furthest from CC;
#giant furthest from CC within cardinal map quarter (divide diagonally), if non in quadrant find next nearest/furthest from CC globally?

Relocate if within l distance of CC? To those Giants/Mutants at least l distance from CC?

Relocate mutants onto smaller zombies at the map edge/at least l distance from the CC? Less likely to avoid terrain clipping than relocating onto giants.

Replace all mutants with smaller zombies. Harpies?


----

Wide-ranging editor options:

--
Make games harder:

Remove Mutants and/or Giant minimap icons?

Adjust zombie type ratios for even harder procedurally-generated maps. Would probably need to generate new zombie IDs.
Potentially also increase the % score scale factor for such maps?

Upgrade all smaller VOD buildings (Dwelling, Tavern) to City Halls of Doom? To try recreate UberVOD(s) on other ThemeTypes?
Or multi-stack the same sized buildings in the same position?

Remove all Pickable resources & reclaimable buildings? To remove potential early Radar vision or resources chiefly accessed via kiting?

Disable Mayors.

Possibly add a script element (that constantly loops?) to spawns a new zombie per troop loss, with specific loss type to zombie spawned pairing. E.g. Harpy for each ranger, Spitter for each Sniper, Mutant for each Thanatos?
Might have to have a pseudo daily/8-hourly/faster wave, that spawns unit types & numbers depending on a diff between previous and current troop counts? So quickly replaced units might not trigger snowballing?


--
Could affect difficulty either way:

Swap the locations of different types to affect distribution difficulty. Depends upon generating LevelFastSerializedEntities?
Specifically, could:
place most/all special infected in concentric rings, e.g. Fatties closest, then Spitters, then Harpies?
place most/all Spitters in 1 cardinal direction, all Harpies in another, all Fatties, etc?

Swap the closest Mutants with the farthest Giants?

#Replace all Giants with Mutants, or all Mutants with Giants?

Alter the size and composition of waves?
Alter the number and timing of waves?
Effectively could offer 50-day challenge map on demand?

Set certain mayors as already chosen? To benefit or miss out on their benefits, depending how they're handled.

Alter the starting troops?


--
Make games easier:

Reposition Ravens to indicate direction to Mutants/Giants/VODs?
Or use sign post assets from custom/campaign maps?
For VODs, convert each building relative position from CC into an angle, consolidate similar-enough angles into a single marker.

#Offer to enlarge the default fog-clearing as a circle of adjustable radius around the CC.

Offer to remove Taverns/City Halls?

Add bonus units/buildings ready to use/place, as though from mayors?

Make starting troops veterans.

----

Other features:

Use a series of auto-backed-up saves during a game to chart the player's economy, pause ratio, zombie kill rate, potential turret & army dps, etc.

Offer to apply or revert Modded Mayors game-wide rules change?
